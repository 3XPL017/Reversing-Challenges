# Reversing-Challenges

## All binaries are ELF format and x64 bit.

## About
All binaries are written in C there will be none wriiten in C++ <br />
These challenges are for practicing your reverse engineering skills. <br />
Challenges are in no specific order just because a challenge maybe be called level00 that does not mean it is easier then level10.<br /> 
If you get this error __bash: file: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error__ this is intended.

## Flags
The flag is a correct password and it is important to note that each challenge may have more then 1 correct password this is intended. <br />

## New to reverse engineering?
Check out my blog https://medium.com/@3XPL017/introduction-to-reverse-engineering-251d6432f7ec <br />
Things you will need include: <br />
1. Knowledge in assembly, C, and Python <br />
2. Know how to use tools such as GDB, IDA, radare, hex editor 

## Tools
Tools I like to use for reverse engineering include: <br />
1. GDB with pwndbg plugin <br />
2. IDA <br />
3. Radare <br />
4. Hex editor of your choice <br />
5. strace and ltrace <br />
6. Scripting language (example: Python) <br />
7. Sublime text (Note taking and scripting)
